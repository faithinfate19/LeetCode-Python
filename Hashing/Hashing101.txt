Hashing data structures in Python

1️⃣ Set: Stores unique values only.

seen = set()
seen.add(3)

if 3 in seen:
    print("found")

Used for:
   - Contains Duplicate
   - Intersection (unique)
   - Fast lookup

2️⃣ Dictionary (Hash Map): Stores key → value pairs.

freq = {}
freq['a'] = 1
freq['a'] += 1

Used for:
    - Counting occurrences
    - Tracking indices
    - Mapping relationships

Hashing Patterns:

Pattern 1: Seen before?

seen = set()
for x in nums:
    if x in seen:
        return True
    seen.add(x)


Example:
    1️⃣Contains Duplicate
    2️⃣Two Sum (variant)

Pattern 2: Frequency counting
freq = {}

for c in s:
    freq[c] = freq.get(c, 0) + 1


for k, v in freq.items():
    if v == 1:
        return k


Example:
    1️⃣Valid Anagram
    2️⃣First Unique Character

Pattern 3: Hashing with indices
seen = {}

for i, num in enumerate(nums):
    if target - num in seen:
        return [seen[target - num], i]
    seen[num] = i


Example:
    1️⃣Two Sum
